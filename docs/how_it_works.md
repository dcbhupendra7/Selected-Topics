# How It Works

## Genetic Algorithm in Simple Terms

Think of it like a big race:

1. **All the birds race** to see who can get the highest score.
2. **Winners get to have "children"** for the next race (next generation).
3. **Children inherit traits** from their parents, but with small random changes (mutations).

## Neural Network in Simple Terms

- A **Neural Network** is like a tiny brain.
- It takes **inputs** (bird's height, pipe positions) and gives an **output** (flap or not).
- Over time, it **learns** the best way to avoid pipes.

**Putting it together**: Each bird has a small brain. We evolve these brains over many generations until the birds get really good at flying!
